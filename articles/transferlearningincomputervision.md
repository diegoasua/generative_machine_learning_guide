# Transfer Learning in Computer Vision

## Fundamental Techniques for Model Knowledge Transfer

Transfer learning enables leveraging pre-trained neural network weights to accelerate learning on new computer vision tasks. By exploiting knowledge learned from large-scale datasets, practitioners can significantly reduce training time and improve model performance.

## Core Transfer Learning Approaches

### Feature Extraction Strategy

In feature extraction, a pre-trained network serves as a fixed feature extractor. The key mathematical transformation can be expressed as:

$$
f_{new} = \text{Backbone}(x, \theta_{pretrained})
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{f}_{\text{new}}$ represents extracted features
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the input image
- $\theta_{\text{pretrained}}$ are frozen pre-trained weights

```python
class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, backbone):
        super().__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(*list(backbone.children())[:-1])
        
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.features(x)

# Example usage with ResNet
backbone = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor(backbone)
```

### Fine-Tuning Approach

Fine-tuning involves unfreezing and retraining some or all layers of a pre-trained network:

$$
\theta_{\text{new}} = \arg\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{X}_{\text{target}})
$$

Practical implementation involves selective layer unfreezing:

```python
def configure_fine_tuning(model, freeze_backbone=True, num_unfrozen_layers=2):
    if freeze_backbone:
        for param in model.features.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
    
    # Unfreeze last few layers
    children = list(model.features.children())
    for layer in children[-num_unfrozen_layers:]:
        for param in layer.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = True
```

## Advanced Transfer Learning Techniques

### Layer-Wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS)

LARS provides layer-specific learning rates:

$$
\eta_l = \eta_0 \cdot \frac{\|\mathbf{w}_l\|}{\|\nabla \mathcal{L}_l\| + \epsilon}
$$

Where:
- $\eta_l$ is the layer-specific learning rate
- $\|\mathbf{w}_l\|$ represents layer weight norm
- $\|\nabla \mathcal{L}_l\|$ is the gradient norm

### Progressive Unfreezing

Progressively unfreeze network layers during training:

```python
def progressive_unfreeze(model, epoch, total_epochs):
    layers = list(model.features.children())
    unfreezing_index = int(len(layers) * (epoch / total_epochs))
    
    for i, layer in enumerate(layers):
        if i >= unfreezing_index:
            for param in layer.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = True
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Learning Rate Scheduling

Implement adaptive learning rate schedules:

```python
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts(
    optimizer, 
    T_0=10,  # Initial restart period
    T_mult=2  # Exponential period increase
)
```

### Regularization Techniques

1. **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting during transfer learning
2. **Weight Decay**: Constrains model complexity
3. **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes feature distributions

## Empirical Considerations

### Model Selection Criteria
- Similarity between source and target domains
- Computational complexity
- Available computational resources

### Computational Metrics

- Transfer learning can reduce training time by $50\%$-$90\%$
- Performance improvement: $10\%$-$30\%$ compared to training from scratch

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

1. Start with pre-trained weights from similar domains
2. Use smaller learning rates during fine-tuning
3. Monitor validation performance closely
4. Experiment with different freezing strategies

## Code Example: Complete Transfer Learning Workflow

```python
def transfer_learning_pipeline(
    source_model, 
    target_dataset, 
    num_classes,
    learning_rate=1e-4
):
    # Modify final classification layer
    source_model.fc = nn.Linear(
        source_model.fc.in_features, 
        num_classes
    )
    
    # Configure optimizer with differential learning rates
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([
        {'params': source_model.features.parameters(), 'lr': learning_rate/10},
        {'params': source_model.fc.parameters(), 'lr': learning_rate}
    ])
    
    return source_model, optimizer
```
